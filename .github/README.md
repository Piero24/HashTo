<h2 id="introduction">üìî  Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This project is designed to map exercises from renowned books and courses to LeetCode problems, enabling everyone to practice coding efficiently without relying on pen and paper or a limited number of test cases. While books are fantastic resources for learning, they often lack a mechanism to validate your solutions automatically. Similarly, courses frequently provide only a handful of test cases, making it challenging to determine whether your solution works across various scenarios.
</p>
<p>
    This platform offers immediate feedback, helping users verify the correctness of their solutions and refine their problem-solving skills. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, it significantly boosts productivity and makes practicing coding much simpler.

<p>
    The project aims to map exercises from famous books, such as <Strong>Cracking the Coding Interview</Strong> and <Strong>Elements of Programming</Strong>, to corresponding problems available on LeetCode. This mapping allows users to practice more effectively and efficiently, helping them gain confidence and proficiency in coding. With this approach, productivity increases remarkably, and the opportunities for hands-on practice grow exponentially. üöÄ
